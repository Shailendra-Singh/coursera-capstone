## A. Introduction

New York and Tokyo are the most populous centre in the United States and Japan, respectively. Though Tokyo is a prefecture of Japan, the population of Tokyo city (~9.27m in 2015) is comparable to that of New York (~8.47m in 2015). I decided to compare these two cities and see how similar or dissimilar they are to one another.

One way to go about comparison is to compare the activities of mobile users from Location Based Social Networks (LSBNs). LSBNs can help to understand the spatial activity preferences of users, that can enable various applications such as venue recommendations based on user's history, location popularity, correlations between most actively visited places to uncover any insights, etc.

The digital footprints collected from LSBNs can help in comparing the preferences and activities of mobile users in New York and Tokyo city, and that can help us visualize how similar or dissimilar they are from one another. We can compare the type of locations (from Foursquare venues) that are frequented and generate comparison charts or clusters on a map to show the differences.

The insights from this can be used in recommendation systems to recommend venues to future users based on historical data. It could also help in deciding where to set up a business by analyzing the correlation between different venue types.
