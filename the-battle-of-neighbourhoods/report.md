### **A. Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>

#### A.1 Background
New York and Tokyo are the most populous centre in the United States and Japan, respectively. Though Tokyo is a prefecture of Japan, the population of Tokyo city (~9.27m in 2015) is comparable to that of New York (~8.47m in 2015). I decided to compare these two cities and see how similar or dissimilar they are to one another.

One way to go about comparison is to compare the activities of mobile users from Location Based Social Networks (LSBNs). LSBNs can help to understand the spatial activity preferences of users, that can enable various applications such as venue recommendations based on user's history, location popularity, correlations between most actively visited places to uncover any insights, etc.

The digital footprints collected from LSBNs can help in comparing the preferences and activities of mobile users in New York and Tokyo city, and that can help us visualize how similar or dissimilar they are from one another. We can compare the type of locations (from Foursquare venues) that are frequented and generate comparison charts or clusters on a map to show the differences.

#### A.2 Possibilities

The insights from this can be used by companies working on recommendation systems to recommend venues to their users based on historical data. It could also help a business owner in deciding where to set up a business by analyzing the correlation between different venue types and near to which location their business would be most profitable.

### **B. Data acquisition and cleaning** <a name="data"></a>

#### B.1 Data Sources

The dataset which I'm using in this project can be acquired from [here](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset). This dataset is originally used for studying the spatial-temporal regularity of user activity in LBSNs **[1]**.

This dataset includes long-term (about 10 months) check-in data in New York city and Tokyo collected from *Foursquare* from 12 April 2012 to 16 February 2013 **[2]**.

It contains two files (NYC and TKY) in tsv format. Each file contains 8 columns, which are:
1. User ID (anonymized)
2. Venue ID (Foursquare)
3. Venue category ID (Foursquare)
4. Venue category name (Fousquare)
5. Latitude
6. Longitude
7. Timezone offset in minutes (The offset in minutes between when this check-in occurred and the same time in UTC)
8. UTC timestamp

There are around **2.27m** check-ins in _New York City_ and **5.37m** check-ins in _Tokyo City_. In above columns, the semantic meaning of a check-in can be found from 'Venue Category Name' (from Foursquare - Endpoint: _'/venues/categories'_ ) column.

As can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2, the given datasets contain venue category name with latitudes and longitudes, but they don't contain the borough and neighbourhood information. To get the venue location info such as region, neighbourhood, etc., there are two easy options: one is to use Google Reverse Geocoding API or to use Foursquare API. However, in both of these options, the API calls are in the premium category.

An alternative (but complex) way is to use GeoJSON files. I've searched on the Internet and found the GeoJSON files for both New York **[3]** and Tokyo **[4]**.

Tokyo's shape file had neighbourhood information nested in polygon coordinates, so I had to flatten the JSON file to a dictionary, and then calculated the _geographic mid point_ from the boundary information for each borough and their neighbourhoods **[5]**.

After parsing both the files the output looks as follows:

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/nyc_neighborhoods.png'/>
<img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/tyo_neighborhoods.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 3. NYC and TYO GeoJSON DataFrame</small></p>

#### B.2 Data Cleaning

The first thing I did was to combine the neighbourhood information to the cities' respective DataFrames. This turned out to be a fairly complex task, but in summary, it goes like this:
- Find the distance between each venue's coordinate to all boroughs' coordinates **[6]**.
- Repeat above for all venues.
- Find the minimum of distances for all boroughs and assign the minimum-distant-borough info to the DataFrame column.
- Repeat for both NYC and TYO DataFrames

This was a computationally intensive task, so I cached the results to local disk. Assign a Country Code column to each DataFrame for differentiation.
After tidying up, the final DataFrame looks as follows:

<p align='center'><small>Figure 4. Combined DataFrame containing <strong>~8m</strong> rows.</small></p>

### **C. Methodology** <a name="methodology"></a>

I used the Folium library to visualize venue categories on maps for both New York and Tokyo data sets.

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/folium_nyc_neighbourhoods.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 5. New York Boroughs</small></p>

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/folium_tyo_neighbourhoods.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 6. Tokyo Boroughs</small></p>

In the datasets, there is UTC timestamp column. I utilized this column to convert time of day column which contains categorical values such as morning, midday, evening, and late night.

I used Foursquare API to fetch venue parent categories to avoid re-clustering the data and just populate the maps. We'll use these categories as our clusters. All the venue types falls in one of the below categories:

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/venue_types.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 7. Venue Types</small></p>

Since the datasets are huge, I narrowed down the k-means-clustering approach to Manhattan, MYC and Kanto, TYO regions only. After applying the algorithm, the neighbourhoods are split between the categories and their weight (probability of its occurence). Following dataframes shows this data:

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/kanto_clusters_df.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 9. Kanto Clusters DataFrame</small></p>

I used above dataframes to visualize the clusters on Folium maps.

### **D. Exploratory Data Analysis** <a name="analysis"></a>

#### D.1 Venue Check-in Behaviour

At face value, how different are these two cities? This can be visualized by creating wordclouds of venue categories. Following are the word clouds:

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/nyc_venue_categories.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 12. New York Venue Categories</small></p>

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/tyo_venue_categories.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 13. Tokyo Venue Categories</small></p>

#### D.2 Most Visited Venue Types

Which types of venues were most visited? This can be visualized by following bar charts:

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/nyc_venue_types.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 14. New York Venue Types Visited</small></p>

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/tyo_venue_types.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 15. Tokyo Venue Types Visited</small></p>

#### D.3 Venue visit time of the day

When were the users most active? The following bar charts would help in visualizing it: 

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/nyc_time_category.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 16. New York Time of Day activity</small></p>

<p align='center'><img src='/coursera-capstone/assets/img/tyo_time_category.png'/></p>
<p align='center'><small>Figure 17. Tokyo Time of Day activity</small></p>

### **E. Results and Discussion** <a name="results"></a>

Just by analyzing charts, we can observe that there is a huge difference in user activities between New York and Tokyo. Looking at the word clouds (`Figure 12 and 13`), the difference just pops up. In NYC word cloud, we see that the New Yorkers spent their time between the office and other recreational places almost evenly. While in Tokyo, it seems that the users mostly spent their time travelling.

Looking at the venue type bar charts of the two cities (`Figure 14 and 15`), we observe similar findings as described before. New Yorkers have visited the dining-out places with an almost equal split among Office, Travel, Public Places, etc. While in Tokyo, the majority of activities falls under Travelling, Food, and Shopping, other activities take up only a small part of the split.

Let's analyze the activities based on the time of the day (`Figure 16 and 17`). People in New York are not much active in the morning, but they spent their time evenly for the rest of the day and are most active in Evening. While in Tokyo, the opposite happens. Most of the activity is in the Morning and Midday and the Evening activities are almost negligible.


### **F. Conclusion** <a name="conclusion"></a>

Just by analyzing the charts and location of different clusters on the map, it can be concluded the people in both cities have a very different lifestyle. 

In future studies, more detailed maps can be created to visualize which types of activities are more prominent and in what places. This kind of analysis could help any business owner to segment their target audience appropriately, analyze churn rate, improve their operations, etc.

Many other kinds of analysis can be done on this dataset and various hidden insights are yet to be uncovered.
